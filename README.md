#ACI Learning Modules#

Please feel free to fork and contribute. However please keep in mind the following guidelines:
- All contirubtions should be example intensive with lots of specific code snipits, pictures and diagrams. The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.  
- Note that contributions to learning labs will be posted for public consumption. As such, you much ensure you have the rights to provide any contributed content.
- All modules are writtin in Markdown.  See below for helpful links and ediotrs.
- Incomplete modules marked (WIP) or work-in-process should be left as-is for now since I am currently working on the first draft to be released shortly.

##Markdown##

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. [Markdown Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

The current modules should serve as good example of Markdown syntax.  In addition, [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a helpful guide.

####Markdown Editors####
You can write Markdown in a plain text editor but there are many desktop and web-based options which allow you preview your work. I recommend Visual Studio Code for a few reasons:
- Easy to use lightweight environement for coding (or writing Markdown)
- Available on MAC, Linux or Windowns
- Github integration
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor
- Very intuitive operation and structure
