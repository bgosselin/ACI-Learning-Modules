#ACI Learning Modules#

Contributions to these Learning Modules are very much welcome. However please keep in mind the following guidelines:
- All contributions should be example-intensive with lots of specific code snippets, pictures and diagrams. The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.  
- Note that contributions to these learning modules will be posted for public consumption. As such, you must ensure you have the rights to provide any contributed content.
- All modules are written in Markdown.  See below for helpful links and editors to improve your Markdown skills.
- Incomplete modules marked WIP (or work-in-process) should be left as-is for now since I am currently working on the first draft to be released shortly.

##Markdown##

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. [Markdown Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

If yourâ€™re new to Markdown or just use it to write simple README files for your Github projects, the current modules should serve as good examples of Markdown syntax.  In addition, [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a helpful guide.

####Markdown Editors####
You can write Markdown in a plain text editor but there are many desktop and web-based options which allow you to preview your work. I recommend Visual Studio Code for a few reasons:
- Easy to use lightweight environment for coding (or writing Markdown)
- Available on MAC, Linux or Windows
- Github Client integration
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor
- Very intuitive operation and structure
