##Classes vs Managed Object##

The concept of object oriented programming in used in the ACI tree. Each MO’s in the MIT is off a certain type (or Class).  The MO’s Class defines its charactistics – its attributeds and where it sits releative to other objects in the tree.  Again, going back to our API call to create a tenant and private network, to create our new tenant, we actually create an object of the type ‘fvTenant’ and gave it the name.  Similar, we create an object of type fvCtx when we wanted to create a new private network or VRF.  fvTenant and fvCtx are the names of the Tenant and Private-Network Classes in the MIT, respectively.  This JSON payload is reproduced below as a reference:

```
{
	"polUni": {
      	"children":[{
          	"fvTenant" : {
              	"attributes" : {
                  	"name" : "ExampleApiTenant"
              	}
              	"children": [{
              		"fvCtx": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "name": "myVRF"
                        }
                    }
              	}]
          	}
      	}]
	}
}
```

*As an interesting side note, the name fvTenant makes as a Class name since it is a virtual fabric Tenant. However fvCtx is not an intuitive name.  Originally, Private-Networks were referred to as Context in ACI, The name was changed but the original MIT Class name for the context or Ctx is still a part of the underlying codebase and API.*

We can refer to a specific MO in our API calls or we can refer to all the MO of the same type or class. When we create the Tenant and Private-Network, our API call contained MO:

```
https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo.json
```

This is to specify that we were working with specific objects.

However, when we wanted to see **all** the tenants in the APIC, we used a GET API call, referring to the whole class, fvTenant:

```
https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?
```  

####Calling a MO####

In the above example we called a specific class.  We could do the same thing with a specific MO. For example, instead of using the /class/fvTenant.json URL to return all the tenants, use the follow API call to return just the tenant we created:

```
GET https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant.json
no payload…
```


Notice that we see the same info as when we retrieved **all** the tenants in the last module but now we only see this info for our single tenant as in the output below:

![Single Tenant Return](https://github.com/bgosselin/ACI-Learning-Modules/blob/master/Foundation/Module%202%20-%20API%20Overview/Content/tenantAPIReturn.png)

##Distinguished Name & Forgiving Model##

In the previous example you may notice to two things in the API and response which seem a little odd:
1. We referred to our tenant as ‘uni/tn-tenant’ in the API URL instead of just its name.
2. In the response, see a number of attributes that we did NOT define we created the tenant.

The first oddity is due to the concept of a Distinguished Name (DN).  There can be many MO’s of the same class as we now know. For instance, there are many Tenants in the ACI fabric which are all of the fvTenant Class.  Furthermore, many MO’s can have varying types of child MO’s. For example, the Policy Universe can have Tenants as child MO’s but it can also have VM Domains, Network Services and serveral other child MO’s. In order to logically separate each MO beyond any ambiguity, each MO had a DN.  In order to know where the MO fits in the tree, the DN is the summation of all the parent elements above the MO.  But the DN also needs to identify each MO’s type or Class, so a prefix is added the MO’s name.  In the case of a tenant, the prefix ‘tn-‘ for tenant name. 
The DN is used in the URL for API call to a specific MO, the DN for our tenant is:

```
uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant
```

The Other oddity you may notice is that we only gave our Tenant a name but in the response above, there are quite a few attitubes that have been defined.  This is because, the API operates in forgiving mode, which means that missing attributes are substituted with default values (if applicable) that are maintained in the internal data management engine (DME).

We can include these default parameters when we initially create the our new tenant MO.  Or, since we have already created our tenant, we can update the attributes in the MO. Let’s a descriptions to our tenant.  We’ll say, “My first tenant :)”.  To do so execute the following API call:

```
POST https://198.18.133.200/api/node/mo.json
{
	"polUni": {
      "children":[{
          "fvTenant" : {
              "attributes" : {
                  	"name" : "ExampleApiTenant",
                    "descr" : "My first tenant :)"
              }
              
          }
      }]
	}
} 
```

Now if you re-issue the GET request with the tenants DN, you should see the updated description.

##APIC HTTP Verbs##

Notice in the previous example, that we updated the Tenant using a POST API call.  The APIC API uses the following verbs:
- POST
- GET
- DELETE

##Assignment: Find the Distinguished Names##

We just saw that the DN for a tenant is:

```
uni/tn-{name-of-tenant}
```

Issue the following REST call to the APIC and look through the results to determine the DN for a Private Network and Bridge Domain that we have created so far:

```
POST https://{IP-of-Apic}/api/node/mo/uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/.json?query-target=children
```

**HINT:** Look at the Distinguished Name “dn” attribute in the respective MO classes.

##Solution##

The DN’s are:

MO | DN |
---| ---
Private Network | "uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/ctx-myVRF"
Bridge Domain | "uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/BD-myBD"

##Assignment: Add a Subnet using the Distinguished Name (DN)##

Earlier in this model we saw how to issue a GET request using a MO’s Distinguished Name.  We can also send a POST requests to the APIC using the Distinguished Name.  As you may have noticed in the assignment where you created a Bridge Domain, starting from the root of the MIT can become very tedious when the MO we need to create is the child Object of several other MO’s in the tree.  Using a DN in with POST call to the APIC can greatly simplify our POST request.  
For example, let’s use this idea to add a second subnet MO to our Bridge Domain.  So far, every time we’ve issued a POST call to create a new MO, we started at the Root of the tree. In the actual URI, the DN we use is ‘uni’ and the first line of the JSON body is ‘polUni’. Now we’ll start of the lowest Object in the tree, just above the new MO we wish to create.  In this case, we’ll start at the Bridge Domain, which is the parent MO of the new Subnet MO we wish to create.
For this assignment you’ll need to make to changes to the POST requests we’ve done so far.

1.	This time, create a POST URI which includes the DN of ‘myBD’.
2.	Start the JSON or XML payload at the Bridge Domain level of the MIT.

##Solution##

Using, JSON, the solution to this assignment would be:

```
POST https://{IP-of-Apic}/api/node/mo/uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/BD-myBD.json
{ 
  "fvBD": {
  	"attributes": {
  		"name": "myBD"
  	}
  	"children" : [{
  		"fvSubnet" : {
  			"attributes" : {
  				"ip" : "192.168.2.1/24"
  			}
  		}  
  	}]
  }
}
```

Similarly, here is the XML solution to this assignment:

```
POST https://{IP-of-APIC}/api/node/mo/uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/BD-myBD.xml 
<fvBD name="myBD">
	<fvSubnet ip="192.168.3.1/24" />
</fvBD>
```
