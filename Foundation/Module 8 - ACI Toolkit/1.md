# ACI API Learning Labs

## Overview
The Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is an innovative architecture designed around open APIs and open standards to radically simplify, optimize, and accelerate the entire application deployment lifecycle. The network policies and logical topologies that have traditionally dictated application design are instead dynamically applied based on the application needs. The solution offers a network fabric designed to support the moves to management automation, programmatic policy and dynamic workload anywhere models. The application fabric accomplishes this with a combination of hardware and software tightly coupled to provide advantages not possible in other models.

All the physical and logical components that comprise the ACI fabric are represented in a hierarchical management information model (MIM), also referred to as the management information tree (MIT).  Each node in the tree represents a managed object (MO) or group of objects that contains its administrative state and its operational state.

The Cisco ACI Fabric is configured using an abstract policy model on the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).  The APIC has a very rich and complete object model that is accessible through a programmatic REST API.  The acitoolkit exposes a small subset of that model in a way that is meant to provide an introduction to the ACI concepts and allow users to get the most common workflows up and running as quickly as possible.

### Lab Purpose
The purpose of this learning lab is to explore some of the basics of the ACI APIC Python toolkit and the structure of  its REST API commands.  You can benefit best from this lab if you are familiar with:

*  <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">**Python** (As a programming language)</a>
*  <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank">**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation)</a>
*  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">**REST** (Representational State Transfer)</a>

The Python toolkit actually uses the ACI REST API to modify and retrieve configuration information.  We will guide you through the Python tutorial code, if you are not familiar with it.  We also have a <a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics/step/1" target="_blank">**Coding 101: REST API Basics Lab**</a> It's an excellent resource to learn how REST and JSON work.

A Python 2.7 tutorial script which makes REST APIC API calls will be the examples for this learning lab.

#### Three HTTP methods are used in APIC REST API
HTTP | Operation
------| ------------
POST | Create/Update
GET | Read (Retrieve)
DELETE | Delete

Before we begin, some background on the ACI object model and terminology is in order.
