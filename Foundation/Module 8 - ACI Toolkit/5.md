Making Direct REST API Calls
============================
In the following steps, we will use the Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> REST client plug-in to automatically push ACI fabric switch configuration through JSON and XML POSTs via the APIC northbound API.  The discovery of the fabric automatically starts after all of the switches are configured.

In these steps, we will actually be using the ACI GUI to view the creation and configuration of network objects.

Logging into the APIC via the API
---------------------------------
1. If you are on a DevNet Zone station, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> is already installed and can be launched either from the Google App Launcher or from chrome by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and hitting Launch App.

2. Open another tab in the browser, and navigate to the APIC login screen at https://providedIP:  
![Figure](/posts/files/aci/signin.png)  
Login with User ID: admin, Password: cisco123.  
If a security warning page similar to the following appears, then click **Advanced** followed by **Proceed to <providedIP>** to proceed to the login screen.

3. Click on **Fabric** in the top menu bar, then on **Inventory** in the sub-menu, and then on **Fabric Membership** in the left pane.  You should see the initial unconfigured leaf switch created when the system is booted:

4. Now click on **Topology** in the left pane to view a graphical representation of the unconfigured network:

5. Click on the **Postman** tab in the browser, and then **Collections** in the left pane.  Open the **APIC REST API Functions** collection and then double-click on the **APIC Login** selection.  The **Send** button can then be used to issue the XML API login command, which should result in a returned status of 200 as shown:

Creating and Configuring the Fabric
-----------------------------------
The following steps use JSON REST API functions to create the spine and leaf switches in our topology.  The final command configures and discovers the fabric using the switches created during the creation steps.   

1. While still in the **Postman** tab, open the **Create Topology** collection and double-click on **Create Spine1** followed by **Send**.  

2. Double-click on **Create Leaf2** followed by **Send**.  

3. You can see what the results of last two steps by selecting the created by going back to the **APIC** tab in the browser, and then under **Fabric->Inventory->Fabric Membership**, the unconfigured fabric is displayed:

4.  Back in the **Postman** tab, double-click on **Configure Leaf1** to start the configuration and discovery process, which can take several minutes to complete.  Back in the **APIC** tab, note the switch model numbers have been identified and IPs assigned:

If you do not wish to wait for discovery to complete, you can move on to the next page and come back to view the progress at any time.  
  
5. Finally, in the **APIC** tab, select **Fabric->Inventory->Topology** to view the graphical representation:
