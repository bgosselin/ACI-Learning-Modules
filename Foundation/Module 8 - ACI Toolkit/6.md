Demo XML REST API Requests 
--------------------------
The following steps demonstrate some of the XML APIC REST requests used to create various network elements. 

1. This step creates the Layer 3 connectivity for a virtual machine network named *vmm*.  In the **Postman** tab, select the **APIC REST API Functions** and double-click **Create L3 Connectivity**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Tenant->mgmt->Networking->External Routed Networks->vmm**:

2. This step creates a VLAN Name Space named *ACILab_VLAN_Pool*. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create VLAN Namespace**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Fabric->Access Policies->Pools->VLAN**:

3. This step creates the Physical Domain for the APIC. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create Physical Domain**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Fabric->Access Policies->Physical and External Domains->Physical Domains**:

4. This step creates a new tenant named *ACILab*, along with the Private Network and Bridge Domains. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create Tenant**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Tenants->ACILab->Networking**, then expand **Bridge Domains** and **Private Networks**:

5. This step creates contracts and filters for Web, App and DB. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create Contracts and Filters**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Tenants->ACILab->Security Policies**, then expand **Contracts** and **Filters**:

6. This step creates an Application Profile called *3Tier_App*. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create Application Profile**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Tenants->ACILab->Application Profiles**, then expand **3Tier_App**:

7. This step creates a Service Graph AppGraph. In the **Postman** tab, double-click **Create Service Graph**, followed by **Send**.  The results can be seen in the **APIC** tab under **Tenants->ACILab->L4-L7 Services->L4-L7 Service Graph Templates**:
