##Creating Scipts Using The SDK##
We have created some very rudimentary APIC configurations so far with the Cobra SDK.  However, it has quite an extensive feature-set by leveraging the underlying raw API from the APIC controllers.  You can use the SDK for advanced configurations as well as gaining data from the the ACI fabric.

There are a number of resouces available to begin exploiting the Cobra SDK for use with advanced ACI functionality, including:

- **Arya:** In Module 6 we'll look at a tool, Arya, which allows us to quickely convert our ACI configurations into a Python file using the SDK.  This tool is invaluable in its ability to help us quickly learn how to programming the ACI fabric using the Cobra SDK.
- **SDK Documentation:** Just as the .egg files and installation instructions for the Cobra SDK were available on the APIC webserver, so to is the API documentaion.  You can access it by navigating in the user interface to Admin >> Documentation >> Python SDK documentation or by going to: https://{IP-of-APIC}/cobra/getting-started.html
