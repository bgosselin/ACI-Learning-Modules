##Tools For ACI##
Unlike a traditional CLI, the APIC API is a well suited interface for building addtional functionality to further simplify our interactions with ACI.  We have already seen two example of this in the Graphic User interface (GUI) and Cobra SDK.  However, there are several other tools at our disposal to help us quickly develop scripts and programs for ACI.  We have already used one of these tools in the [API - Building A Simple Script](https://github.com/bgosselin/ACI-Learning-Modules/blob/master/Foundation/API%20-%20Building%20A%20Simple%20Script.md) module. However, there are several additional tools including:
 - Arya
 - Visore
 - The ACI Toolkit
 
 The API Inspector, Arya and Visore are development tools designed to help you quickly build new code and scripts for use with ACI. While the ACI Toolkit is a collection of projects and libraries developed by Cisco which you can leverage as example projects or to further extend the feature-set of ACI.

 We'll cover all of these tools in the coming modules.
