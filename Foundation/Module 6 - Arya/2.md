##Building a Script from the Arya Output File##
Now that we understand the ExampleAryaTenant.py file we created with Arya, lets turn it into a useful script. We'll use this file to create a new tenant called 'ExampleAryaTenatn' (no surpise there). We'll create the same private layer 3 network and Bridge Domain with a subnet that we have in the ExampleSdkTenant but we'll update the comments for the tenant and private layer 3 network.

There three changes are straight forward; update the tenant Managed Object to reflect the new name and comments, as follows:
```python

```

Next update the private layer 3 network MO with an appropriate comment:
```python

```

We also have to delect the raised error discussed in the last section.

Finally, as we have discoved, everytheing in ACI is an object that has a place in the management information tree (MIT).  Just as with our own Cobra project, the auto generated code has connected the tenant to the top of the MIT, the policy universe, polUni in this case:
```python
fvTenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(polUni, ownerKey=u'', name=u'ExampleAryaTenant', descr=u'My first SDK Tenant', ownerTag=u'')
```

However, polUni was not defined by Arya, the top of the tree was left blank:
```python
polUni = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
```

We'll replace the line of code above with this:
```python
polUni = md.lookupByDn('uni')
```

Lastly, we want to add this new tenant so update the line of code near the bottom from pointed to tree root:
```python
c.addMo(polUni)
```
Instead point towards the new tenant:
```python
c.addMo(fvTenant)
```

##Run the New Script##
Now we execute our new script with the following command:
```
python <path>\ExampleAryaTenant.py
```

You can confirm the script successfully built these new objects using the tools dicussed in Module 1 and 2.
